TODO:
-- pack all resoources in a table
-- rename animations[3] to to character Anaimation
-- refactor Level.lua, SaveGame.lua 
-- implement a Tile- and Item-Selector for LevelEditor.lua

-- add higher level classes Tile.lua and Character.lua
-- add culling and collision detection


Broken features
-- SaveWorld() is broken due to switch to Sprite class (old code still depends on love.graphics.Image)
-- LevelEditor item selecting is broken due to switch to Sprite class (old code still depends on love.graphics.Image)
